## Branch naming convention

### Tests
Branch with tests for future implementation should be named like this: 
```
[chapter number]-[section name]-tests
```
e.g.
```
02-recursion-tests
```
Such branch should be targeted to the `master` branch and marked with `tests` label.

### Implementation
Branch with the implementation should be named like this: 
```
[chapter number]-[section name]-[author's name]
```
e.g.
```
02-recursion-zamonier
```
Such branch should be targeted to author's branch and marked with `implementation` label.
